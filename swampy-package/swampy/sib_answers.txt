Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:
	1 - imports everything from the TurtleWorld module
	2 - creates a TurtleWorld assigned to world
	3 - creates a turtle bob
	4 - function that waits for the user to do something


These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer:
	polygon(t, length, n)
	t - turtle; type - function
	length - distance; type - integer
	n - number of sides; type - integer


-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: 
	fd()
	lt()

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer:
	polyline(t, n, length, angle)
	t - turtle; type - function
	n - number of sides; type - integer
	length - distance; type - integer
	angle - angle of the turtle turn


Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer:
	pu()
	fd()
	pd()
	lt()

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:
	pu()
	rt()
	bk()
	pd()

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer:
	postcondition
